## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to analyze and explore the Netflix content library using SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from the dataset. By leveraging PostgreSQL, this analysis focuses on understanding the distribution, trends, and patterns of Netflix's content, including movies and TV shows. Key objectives include:

 1) Content Categorization: To categorize content based on genres, countries, and ratings to understand Netflix’s content variety.

 2) Trend Analysis: To identify trends in content releases over the years, especially focusing on growth in specific regions like India.

 3) Actor and Director Analysis: To identify key actors and directors associated with Netflix content, and to observe their involvement over time.

 4) Content Characteristics: To analyze movies and TV shows based on attributes like duration, number of seasons, and descriptions (e.g., the presence of keywords like "violence" and "kill").

 5) Geographical Insights: To determine which countries contribute the most to Netflix’s content library and how content availability varies across different regions.

Through this analysis, the project aims to provide insights into Netflix's content strategy, help discover hidden patterns, and offer a comprehensive understanding of the platform’s catalog.
